It really got me thinking of the times I saw her on TV. How sweet she was. All I remember is her helping others. See her with kids. Come to find out, according to ABC World News, she was with kids that were diagnosed with AIDS. This was the time before the way the internet is today and before Social Networking so if you didn't watch the News or read the paper you didn't know.

I just remember see her on TV and hearing her on the radio and her kind voice just soothed my soul. It did today just hearing her voice from a recording. I believe she was such a good kind person God took her early.

The following will be incorporated into a wiki page that is linked here (r/nottheonion/wiki/civilityrules) for easy reference.

In this submission, we affirm that we stand with BLM, LGBTQ+, and other routinely disparaged groups.  Therefore, after consulting with multiple organizations who are active and knowledgeable on these topics, we are further formalizing and clarifying Rule 1.

The purpose of this post is to provide common examples of bigotry upon which we, as r/NotTheOnion moderators, will take action.  Please keep in mind that we will not be debating these topics individually, but you are more than welcome to head to r/socialjustice101 to either ask in good faith about these topics, or, if you are already familiar with them, to educate others.

#This list is non-exhaustive, may be updated frequently, and is applicable to moderator discretion

#Racism: 
* against African Americans or black people in general:
 * black crime statistics, ""black on black violence""
 * any variation on ""despite being 13% of the population, black people commit 50% of the violent crime""  &lt;- this is literally a copypasta/meme created by the white supremacist website, Stormfront.  Variations include:  ""13 do 50, 13/50, the 13%, DESPITE"" (http://redd.it/s8jns2)
 * victim blaming especially after rape or death (not exclusive to racism) (examples:  ""[x person] should have just cooperated with the police"", ""she shouldn't have worn that"", ""well they committed a crime in the past"")
 * referring to black people as animals, specifically apes/monkeys
 * ""what if you said this about black people instead of white people!"" or trying to switch races (this is absolutely an apples-to-oranges comparison. Life isn't a chessboard that you can simply rotate the board and have gameplay be effectively the same)
 * ""all lives matter""
 * dindu nuffin or variations, thugs, ""he was a good boy"", ""he was going to college"", joggers, naggers, ""people who annoy you""
 * WE WUZ KANGZ
 * just posting the letter ""N"" to start an askouija style attempt to create a slur
 * ""affirmative action is racist against white people""
 * ""black people only get into college due to affirmative action""
 * ""diversity hires""
 * ""racism (systemic or otherwise) doesn't exist""
 * ""upvoted because black""
 * 3/5 jokes
 * IQ stats (more affected by general health, nutrition, parents' education level etc than race)
 * Bix Nood
 * ""never relax""
 * black lives splatter/Burn Loot Murder
 * advocating running over protesters (this is also advocating violence, a TOS violation)
 * ""BLM is a terrorist organization""
 * sarcastically saying ""BLM""
 * stupid comments about ""culture""
 * arguing that white people should be allowed to use the N word
* antisemitism
 * global bankers, bankers
 * oy vey, goyim, the goyim know
 * hollywood references
 * 3 parentheses, ""echoes""
 * that comic with the guy rubbing his hands together (""happy merchant"")
 * holocaust denialism
 * ""The Jew cries out in pain as he strikes you""
 * ""people are reading"" some particular supremacist book
* in general, making assumptions about specific people based on racist views about the group or mocking something disparaging about the group as a whole:
 * Indian people:  ""must have been an arranged marriage"", ""designated shitting streets"", ""Indian rape culture"", ""superpower by 2020""
 * Muslim person in the picture:  ""terrorist"", ""religion of peace"", ""islam is right about women"", ""rag head, towel head""
 * Native American/Indigenous person:  ""alcoholic"", ""smallpox blankets""
 * Asian people:  ""Koreans eat dogs/cats"", ""china-virus""/""wuhan flu""/""kung flu"", ""slanty eyes""

#transphobia
 * ""there are only two genders""
 * ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" (or anything else patently absurd)
 * suggesting Michelle Obama is a man
 * intentionally misgendering a trans person
 * referring to being trans as a ""mental illness""
 * suicide statistics/""40%""
 * ""transwomen aren't women""/""transmen aren't men""
 * use of ""tranny""/""trap""
 * decrying children having reassignment surgery (this is already illegal in most countries)
 * ""did you just assume my gender?!""
 * emphasizing regret after transitioning
 * use of ""biological male"" or ""biological female"".  The term is cis male or cis female.
 * anything about transitioning to become better at sports, or ""men have a biological advantage""
 * ""troon"", ""mental illness"", ""groomer"", ""indoctrinating children"", ""you'll never be a real woman""
 * intentionally deadnaming a trans person, which means using their old name over their new one

#sexism 
 * ""women belong in the kitchen""
 * ""the gender pay gap is a myth""
 * ""equal rights and equal lefts""
 * cunts/sluts/whores/slut-shaming
 * ""upvoted because boobs""
 * posting that comic which says women have to include themselves in their photos
 * ""don't be such a girl""
 * ""should have kept her/your legs shut"" on the topic of abortion, financial issues, or other similar issues
 * abortion:  ""baby killer"", ""abortion is murder"" or conflating abortion with actual murder, ""slut""/slut shaming
 * infantilization:  e.g. referring to a woman/women as ""girl(s)"", or other intentionally demeaning and condescending terms

#homophobia
 * equating pedophilia to homosexuality
 * f-word/queer/pillow-biter/etc
 * ""bundle of sticks"" (Almost no one on reddit is an etymologist.  They're only using this phrase because it's the same origin as the f-word)
 * puking emoji with no other context than a gay wedding or pride parade etc
 * ""upvoted because gay""
 * ""being gay is a sin""/""see you in hell""
 * ""fake and gay"" and otherwise using ""gay"" as a pejorative or negative
 * ""groomer"", ""indoctrinating children"", ""lifestyle"", ""sin""

#ableism based bigotry 
 * ""you're only good for stump porn""
 * retarded/aspie/sperg/autistic

#general incivility
 * this is just basically name-calling or personal attacks aimed at a specific user.  Examples:  ""you idiot"", ""you moron"", ""you dumbass"", ""shut the fuck up"", ""suck my dick""

Many users have argued that facts cannot be racist, which is true. However, much of what is purported to be factual is actually twisted by inherent racism. For example, the assertion that black people commit more violent crime than white people is false: In fact, black people are arrested/convicted for violent crime more often than white people. The statistic does not represent a fact-based commentary on a racial proclivity; it represents a way in which systemic racism has unfairly maligned a historically marginalized portion of the population.

Furthermore, even objective facts can be presented in a manner that promotes (or is promoted by) a racist agenda. It may be factual to state that a given entertainer is Jewish, for instance, but if that point is being raised as a means of insinuating something anti-Semitic, it is nonetheless an example of bigotry. Statements of this sort are referred to as ""dog-whistles;"" as coded phrases that are ostensibly based in fact, but which are being presented with bad-faith intentions.

Dog-whistles, implied bigotry, and memetic phrases with bigoted subtexts are all forbidden in /r/NotTheOnion.  Please note that there's a different between attacking a disparaged group who cannot change how they were born, and attacking memberships of groups (e.g. saying ""ACAB"" is not bigotry.  Cops can quit, black people can't stop being black).

Civil criticism of religion, governments, and groups/organizations are fully permitted. Veiled attacks that are instead meant to target and attack a nation/race of people that practice these faiths, is forbidden. 

---

If you don't understand some of the reasons behind these additions, that's ok.  Many people are at different points on their path to education, and everyone should treat it as a process vice a destination.  We encourage users to head over to r/socialjustice101 to either ask about specific points or to explain them to other users if you do understand. We won't be debating these here or in modmail as that's not a debate forum.

‚ÄúGazprom informed that it is not able to confirm the gas volumes requested for today, stating that it‚Äôs not possible to supply gas through Austria. Therefore, today‚Äôs Russian gas supplies to Eni through the Tarvisio entry point will be at zero,‚Äù Eni SpA, Italy‚Äôs largest oil company, said in a statement on its website on Saturday.

An Eni spokesman said that Austria appeared to be receiving gas from Gazprom. 

‚ÄúWe are working to check with Gazprom whether it is possible to reactivate the flows to Italy,‚Äù the spokesman said. 

European countries have been rushing to find alternatives to Russian gas and protect against supply interruptions as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to choke off energy to the continent to put pressure on the European Union over several rounds of sanctions in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

More than 500 retired U.S. military personnel have taken lucrative jobs since 2015 working for foreign governments, mostly in countries known for human rights abuses and political repression, according to our investigation.
 
Since 2016, 15 retired U.S. generals and admirals have worked as paid consultants for the Saudi Defense Ministry and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who U.S. intelligence agencies say approved the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who worked for The Post.
 
Congress permits retired troops and as well as reservists to take foreign jobs if they first obtain approval from their branch of the armed forces and the State Department. 
 
But the U.S. government has fought to keep the hirings secret.
 
To shed light on the matter, we sued the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps and the State Department in federal court under the Freedom of Information Act. 
 
The court battle lasted two years.
 
Ask us anything, and read our investigation here:

This decision was announced by the governor of the region Vyacheslav Gladkov in his Telegram channel. ‚ÄúI decided to transfer all schools, colleges and universities for 2 weeks,‚Äù informed he. From tomorrow, schoolchildren and students from the Belgorod, Borisov, Veidelevsky, Volokonovsky, Krasnoyaruzhsky and Rovno districts will be transferred to the distance learning format. Also, children from universities, colleges and schools of the city of Belgorod and urban districts ‚Äì Valuysky, Grayvoronsky, Shebekinsky and Yakovlevsky will study remotely. Kindergartens in these municipalities will operate on duty.

The safety of children is the main thing that every adult should worry about, Gladkov believes. And he expressed the hope that parents and teachers would agree with this. ‚ÄúTherefore, we are doing everything to ensure that our children are in a safe environment,‚Äù the governor said.

Exactly a week ago, last Monday, there were translated all schools in the Shebekinsky and Valuysky districts. Prior to this, the governor reported that the educational institutions of these municipalities are switching to remote work from September 26. Gladkov explained that the operational situation did not allow returning to the usual mode of study. Therefore, schools located within a 15-kilometer zone in the Shebekinsky and Valuysky districts, and within a 5-kilometer zone in the remaining 6 municipalities of the Belgorod region, will work remotely.",worldnews,"Russian Universities, colleges, and schools of the Belgorod region near Ukraine border ordered to begin remote learning for 2 weeks",1

In the event of a quick Ukrainian defeat, the west would be left supporting an insurgency ‚Äì as the Taliban demonstrated, this is a very cost effective way to harass and harm a great power. Instead, Ukraine stayed upright for the moment and is stuck fighting a costly war of attrition that it cannot win.

This is very important ‚Äì instead of cheaply funding and arming an insurgency, helping coordinate acts of sabotage and the like (something western intelligence agencies excel at), the west (mostly the United States and to a lesser extent the UK) is stuck financing a hemorrhagic Ukrainian state and attempting to prop up its armies. This is far more costly than an insurgency, both in pure dollar amounts and in the level of munitions and equipment that are being poured into Ukraine.

Already, we have seen plenty of evidence that the attempt to supply Ukraine is draining western inventories. Smaller NATO members have already sent much of the capability in their limited arsenals, but even more alarming is the acknowledgment that American stockpiles are being depleted. Leaked texts have revealed that active duty units are being stripped of weaponry for shipment to Ukraine, while a recent¬†Wall Street Journal article¬†claimed that US stockpiles of howitzer ammunition are ‚Äúuncomfortably low.‚Äù ‚Äú",worldnews,"Ukraine War Is Depleting U.S. Ammunition Stockpiles, Sparking Pentagon Concern",1
