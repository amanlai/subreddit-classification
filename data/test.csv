1662640215,"In Iraq‚Äôs November 2021 parliamentary elections, Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr and his Tripartite Coalition won a majority of seats, and were apparently poised to oust former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his Iran-backed Coordination Framework.

However, Iraq‚Äôs constitution, designed to ensure that the rights of its many minorities are not trampled by a tyranny of the majority, has instead left parliament paralysed, unable to confirm a new government.  Protestors have stormed the Green Zone and legislative chamber, MPs have resigned en masse, and a tense, febrile anxiety grips the country.

Beyond the capital, millions of people remain dispossessed, displaced, and largely despised, the casualties of years of war between ISIS and an American-backed coalition.  ISIS has lost all the territory it once controlled, but it has surrendered none of its power to oppress vulnerable people.

What happens next for Iraq?

Is there a cure for its sclerotic democratic institutions, or will the disease fester until the population rises up?  Is there any hope for the tens of thousands of people languishing in its refugee camps, or will ISIS reanimate itself by feeding on the very misery it created?  Can the Iraqi people become masters of their own country and their own lives, or are they forever condemned to be mere actors in dramas scripted by others?

We are delighted that Sarhang Hamasaeed (u/SarhangSalar) will join us in a live-audio Reddit Talk, to address these and other questions.

He is the Director of Middle East Programmes at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington.

The incident unfolded when Rorie Woods, a 55-year-old professional beekeeper, drove up to the home in Longmeadow while deputies were in the process of enforcing the eviction notice, the sheriff's department said in a statement on Wednesday.
""I support people‚Äôs right to protest peacefully but when you cross the line and put my staff and the public in danger, I promise you will be arrested,"" Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi said.

Attempts to reach a lawyer for Woods were unsuccessful.

Woods, who lives in Hadley, Massachusetts, about 25 miles (40 km) north of Longmeadow, faces four felony counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and three counts of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. She also faces a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge.

Local media reported that Woods pleaded not guilty to the charges.

She then smashed the lid of one hive and flipped it off the flatbed, agitating the bees, the sheriff said on Wednesday. They swarmed the area, stinging several officers and bystanders who were nearby. One deputy was taken to the hospital where he was treated.

Meanwhile Woods put on a professional beekeeper suit to protect herself, and she carried a tower of bees to the front door of the home, trying to stop the eviction. At that point, deputies arrested her. the area, he pulled back,"" the office said.""

1663249429,"North Korea is perhaps the world‚Äôs most inscrutable state.

Kim Il-sung remains its constitutionally-enshrined Eternal President, despite the fact that he has been dead for twenty-eight years.  Grave malnutrition is widespread.  The United Nations found that ‚Äúthe gravity, scale, and nature of \[human rights\] violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.‚Äù

Yet, under its national Songun or ‚Äúmilitary first‚Äù policy, North Korea is also a nuclear state.  It has carried out six nuclear denotations, and in 2017, exploded what it described as a thermonuclear bomb, the most devastating of all nuclear weapons.

It has also stockpiled cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, and multi-warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles.  It appears to have the capacity to reach any city in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America.

Kim Jong-un and his regime remain defiant, and belligerent, in the face of international sanctions.  Last week, he formally declared North Korea to be a nuclear power, asserting a right to pre-emptive nuclear strikes, and ruling out any future talks on denuclearisation.

Are North Korea‚Äôs actions deeply irrational, or part of a rational effort to keep the world paralysed by uncertainty and superficial unpredictability?  How can the international community respond to its reckless hostility?  Is there anything we can or should do as the hermit kingdom brandishes threats from its keep?

We are delighted to have **Jenny Town** (u/Conscious-Beyond4051), a Senior Fellow at the Stimson Center, to help us address these and other questions, later today, Thursday 15 September 2022.

She is also Director of the Center‚Äôs 38 North Programme, which provides informed analysis and policy advice on North Korea.  Her expertise is in North Korea, US-DPRK relations, the US-ROK alliance, and Northeast Asia regional security.  She was named one of Worth Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúGroundbreakers 2020: 50 Women Changing the World‚Äù and one of Fast Company‚Äôs Most Creative People in Business in 2019 for her role in co-founding and managing the 38 North website.  She tweets at [@j3nnyt0wn](https://twitter.com/j3nnyt0wn).

1662783309,"We're currently in the process of working with Reddit's community fund to organize an in-person r/worldnews meet-up in Washington D.C. sometime in the near future, but need to get a ballpark estimate of how many people would attend to rent an appropriate sized venue.

If you could realistically attend and are on the fence, please vote yes. We would rather have a large space be half filled than a small space with twice as many occupants.

Whatever the venue, we'll be live hosting our weekly Reddit Talk at the event, handing out r/worldnews swag, providing food/drink, and more! (If you have suggestions for activities, panels, or misc. ideas for the event, please share them in the comments below!)

1666000931,"Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski was greeted in Czƒôstochowa by the opposition: he entered the Jan D≈Çugosz University, where a meeting with PiS supporters was organized, among the whistles of the protesters.

In the hall of the UJD, on the stage on the right side of the rostrum from which the president spoke, three ladies in nursing caps, two small children with white and red flags were seated, who were fidgeted by their parents and another two women during Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski's speech. On the left, adults and similarly uniformed children, only slightly older, sat in fireman's uniforms.

The PiS president initially said the same as he did a few hours earlier in Myszk√≥w, presenting the author's history of Poland after 1989. So it was about starving children, a mechanism that allowed Poland to enter Poland, ""but not on healthy terms"", to foreign capital. Organized crime was an intense pathology, ""with which it was not fought at all."" And when the left coming from the Polish People's Republic did not rule, the PO entered the shoes of the post-communists. - ""Donald Tusk I can't do anything"", but when it comes to something bad, I can do a lot - Kaczy≈Ñski joked, and the hall laughed. That Berlin rules the Union by hiding behind the mask of Brussels etc., etc.

- Before we came to power, civil freedom was limited - said Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski.

- What the other side has to offer, I can hear through the window - he referred to the protests in front of the university building. ""Maybe not everything, but I've been hearing it for thirty days."" Maybe weaker in Myszk√≥w - he noticed. The local area is the home of PiS, where this party gains a lot of votes in the next elections.

Demography - Poland will save Europe by promoting Christianity

Kaczy≈Ñski devoted a lot of time to cultural issues, linking them with demographics.

- We are thinking about the revalorization of the 500 plus, but I cannot declare anything here - he said. He admitted that the program did not bring the expected demographic results. Access to affordable housing can be important. Also the amount of salary. - The cultural issues that are imposed on us are primarily decisive - he diagnosed. - And there are many people like parrots in Poland, they want to imitate what is happening abroad.

He continued: - ""Mr. Donald"" pays attention to things like family life, but what? Abortion or related to the possibility of sex change - but not change through medical or surgical procedures, because it is sometimes needed when people have some mental or even physical defects, the so-called Obviously, these people obviously need to be helped, but it is a matter of gender reassignment by decision. For example, from - he glanced at his watch - at twenty to seven the marshal (he addressed the man in the audience, it was probably the voivodeship marshal - editor's note) was named Zofia.

- Probably there are also gay clubs in the ""holy city"", I don't know, I'm afraid there are in Czƒôstochowa. But the point here is not to promote it - continued the president.

    I do not hope that the times when the 12-year-old will not know what is going on will come back, although I remember such times. But it can't be that 12-year-olds can advertise themselves as lesbians.

In Kaczy≈Ñski's vision, Poland is to be an island of Christian civilization that radiates over Europe. - Every reasonable Pole, patriot, even if he is not a believer, must adopt the Christian system of values. If only because in Poland there is simply no other system of values ‚Äã‚Äãpresent on a larger scale. There is either a Christian system or nihilism.

Kaczy≈Ñski swore that he did not postulate a religious state (he repeated the word ""tolerance"" every now and then), but wanted ""in the interest of all people who were not overcome by madness, to maintain what allowed Poland and Europe to continue this civilization, the most benevolent in history, Christian "". This civilization - again the president immersed himself in history - ensured the progress that ""had been made in two centuries, and even earlier.""

- So we want to resist the external compulsion. The attitude is tough, we are not going to give up. Not because we're intolerant or fanatical, but because we know where this leads to.

During his speech in Czƒôstochowa - but also a few hours earlier in Myszk√≥w - Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski encouraged his supporters to ""keep an eye on the elections"". - There must be two of our supporters in every election commission, and not from time to time. It's not much to sacrifice 24 hours of your life, he encouraged.

According to the PiS chairman, the opposition, as soon as it comes to the conclusion that it may not win, will interfere with reaching the polling stations by organizing riots and brawls. - All this in order to be able to say in Europe later that the elections were not conducted as it should be - claimed Kaczy≈Ñski.",worldnews,"Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski in Czƒôstochowa: Non-believers must adopt the Christian system of values, there is no other in Poland",1
